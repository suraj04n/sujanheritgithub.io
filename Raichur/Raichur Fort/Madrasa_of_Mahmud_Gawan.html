        <p>The Madrasa of Mahmud Gawan is a madrasa or Islamic college in Bidar, Karnataka, India. It was built in the 1460s and is an example of the regional 
          style of Indo-Islamic architecture under the Bahmani Sultanate. This heritage structure is placed under the list of monuments of national importance. 
          Founded by the prime-minister of the sultanate in the late 15th century, it bears testimony to the scholarly genius of Mahmud Gawan, who first came
           to Delhi as a Persian trader (in exile)[2] from Gilan in Iran and moved to Bidar in 1453.<br>Mahmud reportedly built the madrasa with his own money 
           and it functioned like a residential University which was built and maintained on the lines of Madrasa of Khurasan. The imposing and spacious building 
           of the institution is considered as an architectural gem and an important landmark of Bidar.<br>The building is one of those put by UNESCO on its
            "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate </div><div>(despite there being a number of different sultanates).
            <br><br><b>Location:</b><br>It is Situated on the Deccan Plateau 2330 feet above the sea level,[5]: 42  Bidar has long been a place of Cultural and Historical Importance.
             The monument is located between the Chowbara (Clock Tower) and the fort from where it is a few hundred meters away. Remains of the monument stand strong amongst the chaos of
              urban settlement around it. Its principal east facade, now partly ruined, faces the city's main street leading to the Bidar Fort.<br><br><b>History:</b>
              <br>In the reign of Muhammad Shah Bahamani II (1463–1482), Khwaja Mahmud Geelani (better known as Mahmud Gawan), an old noble who bore the title of Maliku't-Tujar built
               the Madrasa[5]: 43  of which the remains still exist. In the time of Firishta, nearly a century and a half later, it was still in perfect preservation and with the great 
               mosque and other buildings by the same founder, in what was called Gawan-ki Chowk (present day Gawan Chowk) were then still applied to the purpose for which they were originally designed.<br>
               In 1635, during the wars of Aurangzeb, Bidar was ravaged by Khan Dauran. In the end of 1656, it was invested by Aurangzeb himself. The historians of this time describes ″he entered the city
                and proceeding to a mosque which had been built 200 years before, in the reign of Bahamani Sultans, he caused the Kutba to be read in the name of his father Emperor Shah Jahan.<br>
                After this capture, the madrasa was principally appropriated as barrack for a body of cavalry, while a room (or rooms) near the left Minar were used to store gunpowder which exploded in an accident. It blew up fully of one-fourth of the edifice, destroying the tower and entrance.
                <br>It is also recorded in history that the structure suffered significant damage following a lightning struck in 1696.<br><br><b>Significance:</b><br>The madrasa however, built to reaffirm Shiaism as the state religion, is clearly modeled on contemporary central Asian buildings.
                 The entire campus gives the grand impression which Islamic architecture awakes in many minds. Intelligent planning and construction have gone into building the madrasa. The surface treatment is composed of color produced by glazed tiles of different hues. Traces of exquisite 
                 colorful tiles are still visible on the walls of the building. The floral decor, arabesque design and decorative inscriptions with arches dominating everywhere make it a fine specimen of Islamic architecture. This was all possible because Mahmud Gawan was familiar with renowned
                  colleges at Samarkhand and Khorasan. The building contains lecture halls, a laboratory, a mosque, students’ hostel, dining room, quarters for teaching faculty. This religious seminary which also taught science and maths was run by a carefully chosen faculty which comprised Islamic
                   scholars, scientists, philosophers and Arabic experts. It is recorded that free boarding, lodging and education to over 500 students from the world over was provided at any given time. The founder had established a library of 3000 volumes in this university before his death; what became of it is not known.
